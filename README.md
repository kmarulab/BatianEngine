This is a Physics Engine I'm creating to implement what I'm learning in my Linear Algebra and Introductory Mechanics classes. I am also using "Game Physics Engine Development" by Ian Millington as a guide. Once I'm done I'll include a detailed readne that provides information on how to successfully run the project on your machine
